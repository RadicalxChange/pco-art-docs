# Steward Eligibility

PCOArt aims to elevate the relationship between art, Artist, Steward, and Creator Circle beyond a purely speculative one. In the PCOArt system, the Artist is given the ability to establish eligibility criteria for prospective Stewards to participate in their work's Auction Pitches.

Currently, Artists can either select an `Open Participation` setting or define an `Allowlist` of eligible Steward addresses. [Optional admin permissions](admin-permissions) allow for Stewardship Eligibility to be updated as desired.

New Steward Eligibility modules can be developed to establish rule-based criteria (e.g. the prospective Steward has previously donated to a select cause on-chain) or whatever other criteria Artists deem appropriate to help cultivate their desired community.
