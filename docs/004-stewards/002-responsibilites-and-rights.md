# Responsibilites & Rights

The relationships between Artists, Stewards, and Creator Circles are core to PCOArt. These relationships aren't just symbolic but embodied within the partial common ownership system.

Artists have the ability to define the responsibilities and rights of Stewards with a "real world" [legal license](../for-artists/instantiating-your-art/legal-license) within the digital license. These licenses go beyond the Honorarium and Stewardship Cycles defined and enforced in the PCOArt smart contracts.

The PCOArt team has provided a boilerplate supporting license for initial artworks, but each Artist may establish additional parameters to fit their jurisdiction, exhibition requirements, commercialization rights, etc.&#x20;

A prospective Steward's bid therefore represents more than a financial contribution to the Creator Circle, but a commitment to uphold the Creator Circle's cause(s) and the Artist's vision for the artwork. Prospective Stewards are expected to review an artwork's license before participating in an Stewardship Inauguration. Accordingly, Artists have the option to create and adjust Stewardship Inauguration Eligibility criteria to help curate their pool of potential Stewards.&#x20;

Ultimately, the current Steward's rights and responsibilities are temporary by design, but each Steward will forever remain part of the networked community grown through the artworkâ€™s circulation.
