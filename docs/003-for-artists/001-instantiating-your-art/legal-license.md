# PCO Legal License

You can use a PCO token to point to a legal license that defines the exact rights and responsibilities a steward has in the case of your project. These can and should go beyond the basic token mechanics.

**We cannot advise you on exactly how to do this!** The possibilities are endless, and as with any legal contract, you should get the advice of a lawyer, and make sure you are complying with the rules that apply to you.

What this page is intended to do is to illustratively suggest some things such a license might accomplish. (This help page is not intended to replace your own research.) Below we sketch, non-comprehensively, what a license might specify. Remember that this is just an example! It does not have to work like this, almost all of the terms could be different or more specific:

## The Steward’s Rights & Responsibilities

The possessor of PCO token corresponding to an artwork (i.e., the steward) has temporary rights, but not permanent ones.

He or she may:

- Possess the artwork
- Display the artwork publicly
- Profit from it, for example by including it in a paid exhibition

He or she may not:

- Destroy the artwork
- Sell rights to the artwork exceeding what they possess; e.g., cannot grant permanent licenses to the work to others
- Alter the artwork or display it in altered or mutilated form
- Display the artwork except under _certain conditions_, as specified by the Creator Circle

## The Creator Circles’ Rights & Responsibilities

The creators circle may:

- Define _ABC conditions_ under which the the work may be displayed and used (e.g., it may be physically exhibited only in South America; it must be stored under certain conditions to keep it safe and in good repair, if a physical work; access to see it must always be free to those who cannot afford to pay; stewards may created derivative works but may not allow others to do so; may only be exhibited at a list of approved galleries; etc., etc.)
- Periodically alter _ABC conditions_ by vote and communicate changes to the steward and or display them on a website.

The creators circle may not:

- Establish new conditions (beyond _ABC conditions_) under which the work may be displayed and used
- Revoke the PCO license or convert the work back to a traditional ownership scheme
