# Welcome to PCOArt

Art enriches society through the weaving of relations between the cultures that create it and the cultures that receive it. **Partial Common Ownership of Art (PCOArt)** is a new evolving system that allows artists, communities, and holders of art to create structures of shared ownership and distribution of value that better reflects those living relationships.

The PCOArt project is initiated by [RadicalxChange ](https://radicalxchange.org/)and the [Future Art Ecosystems](https://futureartecosystems.org/) team at Serpentine Arts Technologies, in collaboration with Graven Prest and Cody Hatfield, with advisory support by Will Holley and Lucy Sollitt.
