# PCO Testnet Mode

PCOArt is currently available for testing on the OP Sepolia testnet. 

RadicalxChange and the Future Art Ecosystems the team at Serpentine Arts Technologies are actively seeking artists and communities interested in developing projects using PCOArt as part of a guided cohort. If you are interested, [please get in touch](fae@serpentinegalleries.org).

## Using the System

This project implements PCO on the blockchain. Interacting with the system of smart contracts requires an Ethereum-compatible wallet and the tokens to pay for transaction fees. These requirements apply for both the testnet and (the to-be-released) production systems.

Testnets are intended to functionally mimic production networks in every way--except the tokens used on the chain are *freely available* and therefore typically don't have financial (or social) value. PCOArt Collections minted during the testnet phase won't be migrated to mainnet automatically but you can easily reproduce them as production releases because of this functional compatability. 

Spend time on testnet getting comfortable with the PCOArt system and how it may integrate with your art practice and community. We'd love your feedback and to see your art on PCOArt Mainnet soon!
