# The Actors

Partial Common Ownership of Art (PCOArt) recognises that today's art and art’s value emerge from the ongoing interactions between artists, communities, organisations, and wider societal dynamics.

PCOArt allows artists to embed the individual commitments their art may have to specific communities, causes, and organisations into the ownership and value distribution model that underwrites the circulation of their work.

Contrary to the traditional ownership model that privileges a single creator (the artist) and an exclusive owner of art (the collector), PCOArt offers a system for recognising the legal and economic status of a plurality of stakeholders and thus allowing art to perform its values not just symbolically but also operationally and materially.

PCOArt incorporates three core stakeholder roles:

*  **Artist(s):** the instigators and authors of the artwork;
* **Creator Circle:** the individuals or entities that are integral to the creation of the work either by providing inspiration and context for the artwork, and/or being implicit in the artwork’s value, and/or are participating in producing and maintaining the artwork;
* **Steward:** the supporter of art for whom the possession of the artwork is a reflection of their commitment to the Creator Circle cause(s) as well as the individual artistic practice.
