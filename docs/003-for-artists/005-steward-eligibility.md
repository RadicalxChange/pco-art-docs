# Steward Eligibility

PCOArt aims to elevate the relationship between art, Artist, Steward, and Creator Circle beyond a purely speculative one. In the PCOArt system, the Artist is given the ability to establish eligibility criteria for prospective Stewards to participate in their work's Auction Pitches.

Currently, Artists can either select an `Open Participation` setting or define an `Allowlist` of eligible addresses. [Optional admin permissions](admin-permissions) allow for Stewardship Eligibility to be updated as desired.

New Steward Eligibility modules can be developed to establish rule-based criteria (e.g. the prospective Steward has previously donated to a select cause on-chain) or whatever other criteria Artists deem appropriate to help cultivate their desired community.

Outside of the Auction Pitch, PCOArt tokens conform to the ERC-721 standard. This means that the token can be transferred to a new address during a Stewardship Period without respect to the `Allowlist`. Therefore, there is trust placed in your allowlist (or maybe a legal license clause) not to transfer Stewardship to an unintended party. 

The next Auction Pitch will return the work to circulation through the prescribed mechanism and enforce the `Allowlist` again.
